# Test 2

## Basic Interaction
- Student started from the same demo as Test 1, with three tasks and their own due dates.  
- They marked a few subtasks as completed and watched the chart update.  
- They understood that the coloured solid lines showed their actual remaining work for each task.  
- They also understood that the dashed lines were the ideal pace for each task up to its deadline.

## student thoughts  

- When looking at the chart, they focused on “where we are right now” in the semester.  
- They noticed that the actual line kept going all the way to the end of the timeline, even for days in the future.  
- They said that seeing the actual line continue into the future felt a bit misleading, because it made it look like the system “knows” what their future progress will be.  
- In their head, they expected the **ideal line** to show the full plan from start to deadline, but they only wanted to see **actual progress up to today**.  
- They imagined a version of the chart where the dashed ideal line still runs all the way to the due date, but the solid actual line simply **stops at today** instead of continuing.  
- They felt that cutting off the actual line at today would make it easier to see the gap between “where I should be” and “where I am now” without any extra visual noise.  
- They thought this would also make it clearer that anything after today is still unknown, instead of looking like a prediction.  
- Overall, they were happy with the component but strongly preferred the idea of **hiding future days on the actual line**, while keeping the future days visible for the ideal line.
