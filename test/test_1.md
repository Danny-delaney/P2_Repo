# Test 1 

## Basic Interaction
- Student could set the start date and due date without confusion.  
- Adding tasks and subtasks was straightforward.  
- They understood each coloured line represented one task.  
- They were able to tell the plan covered “around a month” and that the due date was still weeks away.

## student thoughts

- They imagined that in “real uni life” their tasks almost always have **different deadlines**.  
- They thought the chart felt a bit “too fixed” because every task was being pushed to the same final date.  
- They casually mentioned that an essay would likely be due way earlier than exam revision, so seeing them share one deadline didn’t reflect how they normally plan their work.  
- They said they’d probably want **separate due dates for each task** if they were using this for real.  
- They also imagined that each task should have its own **ideal line**, because each assignment has a different timeline and urgency.  
- They felt the single ideal line makes all tasks look equally urgent, which doesn’t match how assignments actually line up through a semester.  
- They said something like: if an essay is due next week, the ideal line should be steep; exam revision should stretch longer; a group project might fall in between.  
- Overall they saw the chart as useful, but they naturally pictured it working on a **per-task timeline** instead of a single global one.
