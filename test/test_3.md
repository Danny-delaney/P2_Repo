# 3 Test

## Basic Setup

- Version: **v0.3.2** (per-task due dates, ideal vs actual cut at “today”, task customiser)  
- Location: Lab / classroom PC  
- Page: Demo with  
  - Plan start date  
  - Convenience due date  
  - Burndown chart (dashed ideal lines, solid actual lines cut at “today”)

---

## What the student did

- Set a **start date** and a **convenience due date** without any confusion.  
- Edited the three default tasks:
  - Changed titles to match their own modules.  
  - Adjusted **total subtasks** and **completed subtasks** for each task.  
  - Gave each task its own **due date** that made sense for them.  
- Added an extra task using the “Add task” section and understood how total and completed subtasks affected the chart.  
- Removed one task to simplify the plan and saw the chart update immediately.  
- Looked at the chart and correctly read:
  - Which coloured line belonged to which task.  
  - That **dashed lines** were the *ideal pace* to each deadline.  
  - That **solid lines** were *actual progress up to today only*.

## Student reactions

- The student found the task editor **easy to understand**: changing values in the fields made sense and the chart responded in ways they expected.  
- Having a **separate due date per task** felt natural, and they liked that each task’s ideal line sloped towards its own deadline.  
- The way the **actual lines are cut off at “today”** matched how they think about progress:  
  - Past and current work is visible.  
  - Future days stay “empty” on the actual line, which helped them see the gap between “where I should be” and “where I am”.  
- The legend felt clear and useful; they could toggle tasks on and off and immediately see the impact.  
- They said they’d be comfortable using this layout during a real term to keep track of essay deadlines, revision blocks, and reading tasks.  
- They had **no requests for changes** and did not report any confusing behaviour or bugs.

## Outcome

- All core goals were achieved:
  - Per-task due dates and ideal lines understood.  
  - Actual progress up to “today” understood.  
  - Task customisation (titles, subtasks, completion, deadlines) worked smoothly.  
- No UX or functional problems surfaced in this test.  
- Student feedback was positive, and **no further changes were requested**.
